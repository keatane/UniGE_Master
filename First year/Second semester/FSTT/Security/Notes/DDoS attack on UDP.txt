DDoS attack on UDP

UDP has no sessions and no handshake.
We can exploit by sending specific packet spooging (using) the ip of the service to the intermediary (e.g. server that hold sessions) of the service; the intermediary will send the packet to the service.
The size of the first packet is much lower than the size of the second one -> Amplification attack (+ Reflection, done by the intermediary) with factor F=P2/P1

An example could be send to a intermediary dns a simple dns query to have the entire zone of information contained replied to the service (amplification). If the equation of the bandwidth F*Ba >= Bs the attack succeed.

If the original attacker bandwidth is not enough, we can perform a DrDDos (Distributed), so the attacker holds more hosts (called Bots/Zombies) that send request to one or more indermediary that execute a coordinate attack to the service victim. The network between the attacker, the coordinator node (attack -> coordinator -> bots) and the bots is called Botnet. This case can holds more and different factors. Bots can be retrieved from malwares.
