# UniGE Computer Science Master's Degree
a.y. 2023/24, 2024/25

## What's this all about?
This repository contains two years' worth of work from my time at the University of Genoa.

## What's inside?
A complete package of:

- lecture notes (some with terrible handwriting)
- code
- labs / assignments
- projects
- exam questions
- past exam papers
- personal notes and strategies used to revise for various courses

## Is it free?
Yes, everything is published for free under an open-source license. If you find the code useful and/or reuse it, please refer to it to spread the word and help others.
I cannot be held responsible for any misuse of the material provided free of charge.

## Why?
Why not? After all, helping never hurts and it forces UniGE to bring in new stuff...

## Collaborations
Wherever possible, I have acknowledged all collaborations with students and colleagues who contributed to notes and projects, without whom these courses would have been an insurmountable personal obstacle.
Please take a moment to admire, as I do, all the names you find within the files and possibly visit their Social and GitHub profiles to thank them.
